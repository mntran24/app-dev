Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. (hours may be adjusted to accommodate all participants) \nProject Phase: July 31 to August 18. One virtual group meeting per week while you work on your individual project.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board is a federal agency that enforces the National Labor Relations Act. Through the NLRB’s Student Ambassador Program, students will get to engage with NLRB attorneys and investigators, and will learn about the rights of workers and the responsibilities of employers and unions. Students will complete a learning phase and then students will get the opportunity to create a public facing project that the NLRB will help shape and promote. Each student will be assigned an attorney or investigator as a mentor for the public facing project. \n\nExamples of a public facing project can be an article in a student or local newspaper or a presentation with an NLRB representative in a class or conference. This Program is a wonderful opportunity for students to develop familiarity with the law, law enforcement, and federal agencies. Equally as important, students will get the chance to create a project centered on what they have learned. They will develop their project skills, use their creativity, and step forward as leaders. At the end of the Program, they will receive a Certificate of Accomplishment.\n\nSubmit a statement of interest in no more than 1,000 words to the National Labor Relations Board’s Student Ambassador Program, which must include name, grade level at Stuyvesant HS, email, and cell phone number. Submit it to: Teresa Poor, Assistant Regional Director, teresa.poor@nlrb.gov AND to Joane Wong, Senior Attorney, joane.wong@nlrb.gov",

The program’s objective is to inspire young women by providing a hands-on learning experience, during which the students will be paired with a mentor, who will provide one-on-one guidance to the students; be assigned their own research projects, leading to a presentation upon completion of the program; assist surgeons in an outpatient setting, learning more about direct patient experience; join surgeons in the operating room to view firsthand the process of surgery; use the simulation equipment to “operate” on a patient; join resident-led lectures and discussions; read and discuss articles written by female surgeons and about female surgeons.",
